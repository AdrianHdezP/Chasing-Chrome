# Chasing-Chrome
Chasing Chrome is the videogame that Carolina Galán, David García and I developed for our TFC. The game is essentially a platformer with some combat with the dynamic that the levels are a time trial.

Both Carolina Galán and David García were in charge of the artistic aspect of the title. I was in charge of the programming and in general I wanted the whole project to be as scalable as possible. All the code is quite careful keeping in mind SOLID and using certain design patterns for some things. 

You have the game in my Itch.io profile to try it, I encourage you to do it.
